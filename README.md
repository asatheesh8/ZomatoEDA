# ZOMATO - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset. This dataset contains a variety of features that pose a challenge when performing an EDA. 

In this project, we perform:
* Imports - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* Reading the csv.
* General dataset information/statistics.

In EDA, we typically deal with the following tasks:
* Deal with Missing Values.
* Explore Numerical Variables.
* Explore Categorical Variables.
* Finding relationship between features.

We also merge the main dataset with country code dataset for better understanding of the exploration or insights gained.

Finally, we top off this project with visualizing that help answer queries such as:
* Top 3 Countries that use Zomato.
* How the rating are distributed.
* Top 5 Cities that use Zomato.
* Top 10 Cuisines ordered.
